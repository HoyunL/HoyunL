### Hello! i'm hoyun 👋

I aim for a developer who values communication, 커뮤니케이션을 중요시 하는 개발자입니다.

It's a developer who puts a lot of importance on analysis and design, 분석과 설계를 매우 중요시 합니다.

I try to understand the mechanism in everything, regardless of development and non-development, 모든일에 메커니즘을 이해하려고 합니다.
